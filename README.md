Robot League

Web application for running the Robot League (Roboticka Liga) at liga.robotika.sk.

It has been developed by three groups of students at the Department of Applied Informatics at Comenius University in Bratislava:

2013: version 1: Juraj Michalička, Maroš Molek, Vladimír Osvald, Jakub Piteľ, Matej Sedláček, https://code.google.com/archive/p/letna-liga-fll/

2015: version 2 (complete rewrite): Peter Paulovics, Peter Kuljovský, Lívia Kupčuliaková, Daniel Linhart, https://github.com/Chaos-TIS/letna-liga

2016: version 3 (complete rewrite): Jonatan Ondrej Foltýn, Peter Hlatky, Eva Kunovská, Viliam Vakerman, https://github.com/TIS2016/Roboticka-Liga

Later it has been updated and maintained by the contest organizers and therefore moved to a new repository so that it contains only the relevant information.
