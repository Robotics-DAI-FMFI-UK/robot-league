                <h2>Do you like to build and program LEGO robots? Join the Robot League!</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>there will be 5 rounds, but you can try to compete in any number of them</li>
                    <li>for teams with multiple members of the ages 9-16 (you don't have to be registered in another competition, we are an independent contest)</li>
                    <li>a new assignment with two tasks approximately every 4 weeks and you have at least 5 weeks to solve it</li>
		    <li>in each round, there will task for rabbits (2 tasks), for tigers (2 tasks), and for simulants (2 tasks)</li>
                    <li>every team will choose if they wish to submit a rabbit task, tiger task, or simulation task, they will score on a separate result table. 
			rabbit tasks are meant for those who started to work with the robot sets this school year or recently, and tiger tasks for the rest of us who have access to hardware set, and the simulant category for those who still would like to participate, but have no robotic hardware, they use the Open Roberta Lab simulator.</li>
		    <li>in addition to the solution to a task, you can upload information about any other robot model you built (even not built of LEGO pieces). We will evaluate these models as well, but the main purpose is to share them with other teams, visitors and us! These models are published at <a href="https://galeria.robotika.sk/">galeria.robotika.sk</a> - please contact us at pavel.petrovic@gmail.com, if you would like to contribute!</li>
                    <li>fair play and a healhy competitive spirit</li>
                    <li>participation costs nothing! you can enjoy solving many various tasks per season!</li>
                    <li>no stress and tournament frustrations, you and the robot have as much time and the number of trials as you need to complete the mission</li>
                    <li>you can't miss this!</li>
                </ul>

		<h2>News: a category for simulants :-)</h2>
		In order to give the possibility to participate also to those who do not own a robotics set, we added a new "simulants" category. You will be solving the tasks using the Open Roberta Lab, <a href="https://lab.open-roberta.org/">lab.open-roberta.org</a>. This programming environment can be used to program real robots, but it also contains a simulator. In solutions to the tasks in this league, please use some version of the EV3 set (for example EV3 Dev). We recommend you to first go through all the tutorials that can also be tried on our local server, <a href="https://robotika.sk/roba/">robotika.sk/roba</a>. If you prefer to run your own server with tutorials, look here <a href="https://robotika.sk/roberta/">robotika.sk/roberta</a>. If you have any questions regarding this category, please let us know!

                <h2>Rules</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>A team solves an assignment in the club, school or at home and uploads their solution on this website.</li>
                    <li>Each team has an adult leader who is responsible for the activities of the team and the content uploaded, but he or she does not help the team with solving the tasks.</li>
                    <li>A solution should contain: <ol>
			<li>a description of the solution,</li>
			<li>a photo of the team,</li>
			<li>a photo of the robot showing how the robot is constructed (screenshots of result for simulated league)</li>
			<li>the program</li>
			<li>and a video showing how the robot solves the problem (screen recording with OBS Studio for simulated league).</li>
			</ol>
			 <i>Hint: Nobody will find
                            your video on YouTube if you mark it as "unlisted", even if you upload it before the deadline. When recording the video, make sure to keep the phone/camera stable, do record multiple situations so that the jury can see your robot really solves the task, try to keep the length under 2 minutes. Please use the landscape mode. </i>
                    </li>
                    <li>You can use any LEGO parts, as well as rubber bands and ropes. Any programming language is allowed. </li>
                    <li>Your solution will be rated with 0-3 points, which will be added to your overall current year score. The better score from the two tasks in the assignment will be counted, but you can solve both tasks (the other score will be counted separately).</li>
                    <li>An independent jury is in charge of rating your solutions</li>
                    <li>If you find an assignment too difficult, simplify it according to your needs! (And explain it in the solution)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How do we rate?</h2>
                <p>
                    Your solutions will be precisely analysed by these 4 people: Karolína - assistant professor at FMFI UK, Miška from FMFI UK who helped us in organizing FLL, Palo from FMFI UK and Rišo - teacher at FEI STU, the contest is coordinated by Pavel Petrovič - a teacher from FMFI UK:
                </p>
				<ul id="photo_gallery">
					<li><img src="image/karolina_mayerova.jpg"><br>Karolína Miková</li>
					<li><img src="image/michaela_axamitova.jpg"><br>Michaela Axamitová</li>
					<li><img src="image/richard_balogh.jpg"><br>Richard Balogh</li>
					<li><img src="image/pavel_petrovic.jpg"><br>Pavel Petrovič</li>
				</ul>
                <p>
                    Every one of them will independently assign 0-3 points, depending on the originality and completeness of the solution (it contains pictures, a video, a program,
                    a good description and the robot is doing what he should be doing). The arithmetic mean of their ratings will be added to the table. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><i>Note: The Robot League is not a direct part of another competition, but it can be useful as a pre-competition training brought by <a href="http://robotika.sk/" target="_top">Robotika.SK</a>, <a href="http://www.fmph.uniba.sk/">FMFI UK</a>, <a href="http://www.fei.stuba.sk/">FEI STU</a>, and <a href="http://www.cvtisr.sk">CVTI SR</a>.
